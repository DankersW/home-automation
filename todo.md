# Todo

- Update architecture view
- Get the system to run again after many updates
- Create "Dobby" to handle all wireless devices
- Make the Thread gateway pass raw protobuf message to the cli
- Move the iot-gateway for mqtt code to "dobby"
- Map device ID's to device names, maybe make a simple embedded DB for this.
- RPC for intenter service communication. maybe Kafka with Protobuf
- Re-think the home-automation-framework, maybe it should be the brain of the system, talking to other parts of the system, like Dobby or the DB-driver using RPC calls
