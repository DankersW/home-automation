# Todo

- Update architecture view
- Move the iot-gateway for mqtt code to "dobby"
- Map device ID's to device names, maybe make a simple embedded DB for this.
- Re-think the home-automation-framework, maybe it should be the brain of the system, talking to other parts of the system, like Dobby or the DB-driver using RPC calls
- Create Pakhuis which writes data into the db
- Create a simulator that mimiks data comming in to Dobby (wsn + wifi)
