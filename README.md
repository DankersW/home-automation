# Home-automation

My Home-automation project consists of several different components aka services with their own responsibility and divided in their own repositories.

## Getting started

This is very simple due to the power of Docker. The system runs on both ARM and x86, keep in mind that the ARM setup is used as a production setup on my RPI. In the future the PROD setup will be replaced by a Kubernetes setup. The DEV setup will keep using Docker-compose.

```sh
# x86
docker-compose -f docker-compose_dev-x86.yml up -d

# ARM used also as the production image
docker-compose -f docker-compose_prod-arm.yml up -d
```

## Wish-list

Listing of ideas and want-to-have items that I might implement in the future

* **Battery level:** monitor and report batter level of embedded devices
* **Mobile GUI:** make the frontend mobile friendly
* **Weather station:** measure outdoor weather conditions (sunlight, temp, humi, etc)
* **Public transportation departure times:** hook into VÃ¤sttrafikes API
* **home-hub:** a small smart-mirror style GUI that shows an nice view with the weather, shopping list, calender, buss departures times, some device statuses, etc.
* **Blinds control:** control blinds of the house via a schedule
* **System diagnostics:** Run some system diagnostics from the frontend
* **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes cluster for all the containers
* **CD pipeline:** CD pipeline deploying the the kubernetes cluster
* **Who is home:** Keep track of who is home by checking the phones MAC-addresses from the router
* **Schedular:** Transform the home-automation-framework to become a schedular instead
* **Reachable from the internet:** Make some part reachable from the internet
